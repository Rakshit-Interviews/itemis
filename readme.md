## Problem 1: SALES TAXES

I have solved this problem using the following technologies in a Full stack way. 

- Angular in the front end
- Mongo Db as a database for persisting the items required for shopping
- NodeJs and Loopback for Backend

# Deployment
- Easy deployment using Docker
- Just turn on the docker service
- Make sure ports 80, 8080 and 3000 are free
- Run the script `./restart-docker.sh`

# Methodology
- After running the application, just run `http://localhost/`
- Just upload the data file `data-itemis.csv` using the front end, and start adding the items after that. 
- This application which has a category as a column in the CSV file can be used to calculate sales tax.
